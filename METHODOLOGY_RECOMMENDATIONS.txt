RESCUELENS AI - DISASTER DAMAGE ASSESSMENT METHODOLOGY RECOMMENDATIONS
================================================================================

CURRENT APPROACH ASSESSMENT
---------------------------
What You're Doing: Zero-shot LLM vision (Claude Opus) + detailed FEMA prompting + structured JSON output

Strengths:
- Flexible - handles novel damage types without retraining
- Explainable - produces detailed justifications for each classification
- No training data required to get started
- Easy to update rules (just edit the system prompt)

Weaknesses:
- Inconsistent across similar images (no memory between assessments)
- Can miss subtle visual cues (water stains, hairline cracks)
- Expensive at scale (~$0.15+ per image with Opus)
- Does not learn from corrections

================================================================================
RECOMMENDED METHODOLOGIES (Ranked by ROI)
================================================================================

1. FEW-SHOT LEARNING WITH REFERENCE IMAGES [BEST ROI]
------------------------------------------------------
Add 2-3 labeled example images PER severity level to your prompt. This dramatically improves consistency by giving the model calibration points.

Example prompt additions:
  "Here's an example of MAJOR damage: [image] - water line at outlet height"
  "Here's an example of MINOR damage: [image] - water below outlets"

Why it works: LLMs are great pattern matchers but need anchors. Reference images give calibration.
Effort: Low (collect 15-20 good reference images)
Impact: High (30-50% consistency improvement)


2. HYBRID: LLM + CUSTOM CLASSIFIER
----------------------------------
Train a lightweight CNN to detect specific features (water line height, structural breach, home type), then feed those detections TO Claude as structured input.

Example workflow:
  1. CNN detects: "Water line at 24 inches"
  2. Feed to Claude: "Classify this conventional home with water at 24 inches"

Why it works: CNNs excel at repetitive visual tasks. LLMs excel at reasoning. Combine both.
Effort: Medium (need ~500+ labeled images per class)
Impact: Very High


3. HUMAN-IN-THE-LOOP + PROMPT REFINEMENT
----------------------------------------
Track where the model fails and WHY. Common failure patterns:
- Overestimates damage from debris
- Misses water stains
- Confuses accessory structures with primary dwelling

Then add explicit rules for each failure mode:
  "CRITICAL: Tree in yard != tree through roof. Verify penetration."

Why it works: Your FEMA rules are good. The issue is usually edge cases not covered.
Effort: Low (logging + prompt iteration)
Impact: Medium-High


4. FINE-TUNED VISION MODEL (Future)
-----------------------------------
If you accumulate 5,000+ labeled images, fine-tune a vision model like:
- GPT-4V (OpenAI fine-tuning)
- Qwen-VL (open source, fine-tunable)
- Florence-2 (Microsoft, good for detection)

Why it works: Domain-specific training beats general prompting for specialized tasks.
Effort: High (dataset collection, training infrastructure)
Impact: Highest (but requires scale)


================================================================================
RECOMMENDED ACTION PLAN
================================================================================

1. IMMEDIATELY: Add 2-3 reference images per severity level to the prompt

2. SHORT-TERM: Log assessment failures and add explicit error-correction rules

3. MEDIUM-TERM: Build a water-line height detector (CNN) to feed measurements to Claude

4. LONG-TERM: Collect a labeled dataset of 5,000+ images for fine-tuning
